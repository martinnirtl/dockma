## Features

Level up your docker-compose game during development by the following main features:

- No more navigating to your docker-compose files
- Develop locally while the rest of your micro-services run inside docker
- Launch your defined services with an interactive CLI or directly from the command line
- Switch between your docker-compose based projects quickly
- Extend dockma by custom scripts and bring your own specific functionality (e.g. database import/export scripts)

## Install

Dockma CLI gets built and released for the following operating systems. If your platform is not supported, you can also [build **dockma** from source](#build-dockma-from-source).

### macOS

The recommended way to install dockma on macOS is to use the **dockma** homebrew-tap:

```
brew install martinnirtl/dockma`
```

Another option is to use the install script:

```
curl TODO
```

### Linux

### Windows

### Build dockma from source

To build dockma from source, you have to install [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) first. Afterwards just clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/martinnirtl/dockma.git` and execute `make build` in the project directory. This will generate a dockma binary in _builds_ named **dockma**.

**Linux or macOS:** You can `cp` the binary to _/usr/local/bin_ or create a symlink with `ln -s` to make it available globally.

## Setup

To initialize **dockma** on your system just run the following command:

// dockma init GIF

Afterwards you usually would continue with adding the first docker-compose based project to **dockma**:

// dockma env init dockma/examples/hello-world GIF

## Usage

## Roadmap

### Features/Todos

- build command/solution to change selection without downing env in between
- add support for env var prefix (eg. 'DOCKMA\_') and make configurable per environment (subcommand 'env set' is taken and should prob be changed to 'env act(ivate)')
- think about wrapping viper completely in config package
- add logging for verbose output
  - inspect cmd only for external commands
  - verboseFlag shall ignore timebridgers
- use tabby and tablewriter where it makes sense
- write long command descriptions (eg. doctl help completion)
- rethink git-pull setting and updating it becoming git-based project
- use table instead of long lists (dockma profile list --services)
- add 'dynamic' bash completion
- support swarm mode and move towards kubernetes ?
- build "assessment" tool for docker-compose files
- write unit tests ðŸ˜‚

### Other

- use bats for system tests (https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)
- show build tags etc. on top of readme
